1. Deflated Tire Problem
    
    if you have the lug-wrench, jack and spare tire with you
        place the jack underneath the back end of the car
	
	while the back wheels are touching the ground
	    turn the crank on the jack counter-clockwise

	lock the jack in place
       
	 for all nuts on wheel
 	    place lug-wrench on the nut
  	    
	    while the nut is still on the thread
	        turn the lug-wrench 1 turn counter-clockwise
            place the  nut in a pile
                 
	remove flat tire
	place flat tire in the back of your car
        line up the holes on the spare tire with the threads on the wheel
	place spare tire on empty wheel
	
	for all nuts in the pile
	    place the nut on a thread
	    place the lug-wrench on the nut

	    while the nut is not completely screwed on
		turn the lug-wrench 1 turn clockwise

	while the rear wheels of the car are not touching the ground
	   turn the crank on the jack clockwise       	
    else
        if you own a cell phone
            call someone to help you
        else
            start walking

2. Convert decimal numbers to binary

    define variables power and answer as integers both starting at 0
    define binary as a string = ""

    while 2^power <= decimal input  given
	increment power by 1
    
    binary += "1"
    answer += 2^power
    decrement power by 1

    while power >= 0
	if 2^power > decimal -  answer
	    binary += "0"
        else
            binary += "1"
            answer += 2^power
	decrement power by 1

    binary will be your answer

3. Fraction Problem

    if your two fractions have the same base
        add the two top numbers and put them over the base
    else
	find the least common multiple of the bases
	
	to find the lcm:
	    put the multiples of each base into a list(base is 2: 2,4,6,8,10)
	    find the smallest number that both lists share
	    that number is your new base
    	    multiply each fraction by the (lcm / base)
	    add the numerators and divide by the common base
